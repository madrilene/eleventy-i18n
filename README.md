# eleventy-i18n

Minimal starter for localized content, using Eleventy's own Internationalization (I18n) plugin.

In an article on my personal website, I describe the structure of the starter and the decisions behind it: https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/internationalization-with-eleventy-20-and-netlify/

## Development

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Working locally

Starts development server by default on `http://localhost:8080`. Watches tasks to compile when changes detected.
Remember to manually change to a local folder: `http://localhost:8080/en/`. Redirects are only working on the server.

```
npm start
```

### Creating a production build

```
npm run build
```
